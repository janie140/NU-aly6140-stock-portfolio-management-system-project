Stock Portfolio Management System: The objective is to create a stock portfolio management system that allows users to manage their investments effectively.

The system will provide the following features:

*Portfolio Management: Users can add stocks, update, or remove them from their portfolio, including information like stock symbol plus company name, purchase date, purchase price, and quantity. Users can make separate portfolios.

*Real-Time Stock Prices: The system will retrieve real-time stock prices using financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance). Hence, users can view the current value of their portfolio based on the latest stock prices.

*Performance Metrics: The system will calculate key portfolio performance metrics, including total portfolio value, total gain/loss, percentage gain/loss, etc.

*Visualization: Users can visualize their portfolio's performance and check historical performance trends using interactive charts.
